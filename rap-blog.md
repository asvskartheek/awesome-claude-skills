# How to Rap for Beginners: 
A Complete Guide to Better Flow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltyaFgMIT4 
Most new rappers make the same mistake. They spend all their time writing lyrics. They find great rhymes and tell stories, but when they try to rap over a beat, it sounds off. This happens because they are only focusing on half of the skill. To be a great rapper, you have to master both **rhythm and poetry**. If you want your lyrics to sound impressive, you must learn the musical side of rap. ## Understanding the Musical Side of Rap To understand rap, you need to know how music is measured. Rappers use **bars** to measure distance. Think of a bar like a mile or a kilometer. It is a set length of time. If a producer asks for a verse, they won't usually ask for "one minute of rapping." Instead, they will ask for a **16-bar verse**. While a bar is always the same "distance," the speed changes. This speed is called **Tempo** or **BPM** (Beats Per Minute). Just like a sports car covers a mile faster than a lawnmower, a high BPM song moves through bars faster than a slow song. ### Breaking Down the Bar Every bar is divided into smaller pieces called **beats**. In most rap music, there are four beats in one bar. To stay "on beat," you need to land your words or syllables on these specific counts. * **The Kick Drum:** Usually lands on the first and third beat. * **The Snare Drum:** Usually lands on the second and fourth beat. ## The Rhythm of Your Words You don't just rap on the main beats. You also rap in the spaces between them. This is how you create "rhythm." We name these notes based on how we divide the bar. ### Quarter Notes (The 4 Count) If you say one word on every beat, you are using **quarter notes**. **Practice:** Say "1, 2, 3, 4" along with the beat. This is the foundation of your rhythm. ### Eighth Notes (The 8 Count) If you divide each beat in half, you get **eighth notes**. This gives you eight places to put a syllable in one bar. **Practice:** Say "1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and." The "and" is the half-beat between the main counts. ### Sixteenth Notes (The 16 Count) If you divide each eighth note in half again, you get **sixteenth notes**. There are four of these in every beat. These are the most common notes rappers use. **Practice:** Use the phrase "One-you-better, Two-you-better, Three-you-better, Four-you-better." Each syllable represents a sixteenth note. ## Creating Your Rap Flow with Cadences Once you know the counts, you can start building **cadences**. A cadence is a pattern of different notes and pauses. Think of cadences as the "dance moves" of a rapper. The more patterns you know, the more interesting your flow will be. ### How to Use Scatting Rappers use a trick called **scatting** to find new flows. Scatting is making random sounds with your mouth instead of real words. This lets you act like a musical instrument. You can focus purely on the rhythm without worrying about what the words mean. Once you find a rhythm you like through scatting, you can "solve the problem" by fitting your lyrics into that rhythm. You might need to change a word or shift a syllable to make the lyrics match the cadence perfectly. ## How to Structure Your Lyrics Don't write your lyrics in one big paragraph. This makes it hard to remember your timing. Instead, treat every line of your lyrics as **one bar**. | Lyric Feature | How to Format It | | :--- | :--- | | **New Bar** | Start a new line for every bar. | | **Breaks** | Write a **(B)** if you take a breath on the first beat. | | **Word Splits** | Split a word across two lines if it crosses into the next bar. | | **Groups** | Group your lines into sets of four for easy reading. | Writing this way helps you see where your rhymes land. It also helps you keep your timing consistent when you perform. ## Using Patterns to Make Your Rap Catchy Human ears love **patterns**. If your rap is too random, it sounds messy. To make your songs catchy, you need to create three layers of patterns. ### 1. Cadence Patterns You should repeat your rhythm patterns. You don't have to make every bar exactly the same. However, keeping parts of the rhythm similar across two or four bars helps the listener follow along. ### 2. Rhyme Scheme Patterns A rhyme scheme is when you rhyme in the same place for at least two bars. You can use **internal rhymes** (rhymes inside a bar) or **end rhymes** (rhymes at the end of a bar). When you place your rhymes in the same spot on each beat, it creates a strong pattern. ### 3. Delivery Patterns Delivery is the **emotion and tone** you use. For example, you might use a relaxed tone for most of the bar but get louder or higher in pitch on your rhyming words. This makes the rhymes "pop" and gives your rap a 3D effect. ## Tips for Success * **Use Even Numbers:** Always try to keep your patterns going for an even number of bars, like 2, 4, or 8. Odd numbers often feel unfinished to the listener. * **Keep it Simple:** Start with basic 8-count and 16-count patterns before trying complex flows. * **Practice Scatting:** Spend time rapping nonsense sounds over beats to discover new rhythms. ## Conclusion Learning to rap is about more than just finding words that rhyme. It is about understanding how to be a musical instrument. By mastering bars, beats, and cadences, you can turn simple lyrics into a professional-sounding flow. Remember that there are no strict rules in rap, only techniques that help you express yourself better.
