## Table Format Deep Dive

### When to Use 16-Column vs 32-Column

**16-Column Table** (Standard):
- Use for 90% of rap songs
- Tempo: 60-180 BPM
- Each column = one sixteenth note
- Best for: Clarity, visual patterns, beat alignment

**32-Column Table** (Advanced):
- Use for very fast technical flows
- Tempo: 140+ BPM with dense lyrics
- Each column = one thirty-second note
- Best for: Precision timing, double-time flows, showing micro-timing

### 32-Column Table Structure

| 1|e|&|a|2|e|&|a|3|e|&|a|4|e|&|a|1|e|&|a|2|e|&|a|3|e|&|a|4|e|&|a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Column mapping**:
- Columns 1, 9, 17, 25 = Beats 1, 2, 3, 4 (downbeats)
- Every 8th column = Sixteenth note positions
- All 32 columns = Thirty-second note precision

### Practical Example: Same Lyric in Both Formats

**16-Column (Standard)**:

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I'm | rap | ping | fast | but | not | too | dense | just | six | teen | note | **sense** | | | |

**32-Column (Technical)**:

| 1|e|&|a|2|e|&|a|3|e|&|a|4|e|&|a|1|e|&|a|2|e|&|a|3|e|&|a|4|e|&|a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|I'm|rap|ping|su|per|fast|with|tech|ni|cal|pre|ci|sion|hit|ting|thir|ty|se|cond|notes|with|per|fect|ti|ming|and|de|ci|sion|here|we|go|

**Key difference**: 32-column allows twice the syllable density per bar.

### Advanced Table Techniques

**1. Merged Cells for Held Notes**:
```
Instead of: | sooo | | | | |
Use merged cell notation: | sooo [HOLD 4 columns] |
```

**2. Color/Emphasis Coding**:
- **Bold** = Louder delivery
- *Italic* = Softer delivery
- `Code` = Staccato/sharp
- CAPS = Shouted

**3. Breath Marks**:
- Use `|` in cell for breath intake
- Use `(B)` at start of bar for full breath

**4. Rhyme Highlighting**:
Mark rhyming syllables in bold or with ** to see patterns align

### Reading the Table

**Horizontal (left to right)**: Time progression within a bar
**Vertical (top to bottom)**: Multiple bars stacked
**Empty cells**: Silence, rest, or held note from previous cell
**Column alignment**: Same column = same rhythmic position

## Note Values and Division

### The Complete Breakdown

In a single bar with 4 beats:

```
Bar divided into quarters (4 notes):
|     1     |     2     |     3     |     4     |

Bar divided into eighths (8 notes):
| 1  &  | 2  &  | 3  &  | 4  &  |

Bar divided into sixteenths (16 notes):
| 1 e & a | 2 e & a | 3 e & a | 4 e & a |
```

**Sixteenth note labels**:
- **1** = On the beat (downbeat)
- **e** = First sixteenth after
- **&** = Eighth note position (halfway between beats)
- **a** = Last sixteenth before next beat

### Syllable Placement Chart

| Count | Position | Practice Phrase | When to Use |
|-------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| 4-count | On beats only | "One, Two, Three, Four" | Slow, emphatic delivery |
| 8-count | Beats + halfway | "1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and" | Moderate pace, clear flow |
| 16-count | All positions | "1-e-and-a 2-e-and-a..." | Fast rap, dense lyrics |

## Advanced Cadence Patterns

All patterns shown in 16-column table format for precision.

### Pattern 1: Mixed Rhythm Cadence

Combine different note values in one bar:

**Concept**:
- Beat 1: Sixteenth notes (4 syllables)
- Beat 2: Eighth notes (2 syllables)
- Beat 3: Quarter note (1 syllable)
- Beat 4: Eighth notes (2 syllables)

**Table Format**:

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I'm | com | ing | with | the | | heat | and | **FIRE** | | | | burn | | ing | |

### Pattern 2: Syncopation

Land syllables *off* the main beat for rhythmic interest:

**Regular (on beat)**:

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Step** | | | | **Step** | | | | **Step** | | | | **Step** | | | |

**Syncopated (off beat)**:

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | and | | | | and | | | | and | | | | and | |

**Combined (powerful pattern)**:

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Yes | | I | | do | | it | | all | | the | | day | | | |

### Pattern 3: Triplet Flow

Divide each beat into THREE instead of two or four. Note: Triplets don't align perfectly with 16th note grid, but we approximate:

**16-Column Approximation**:

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I | can | rap | | in | tri | plets | | mak | ing | some | | thing | new | er | |

**Note**: Triplet timing is slightly off-grid. Use 32-column or special notation for true triplets.

### Pattern 4: Double-Time

Rap at twice the speed while the beat stays the same:

- Count sixteenth notes as if they're eighth notes
- Effectively fitting 32 syllables in a bar
- Very advanced technique

### Pattern 5: Half-Time

Rap at half the speed, stretching words across beats:

```
Instead of: "One word per beat"
Do this:    "Ooooone wooooord peeeeer beeeeat"
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Count Mastery

Practice each count for 5 minutes daily:

1. **Quarter notes**: Say "1, 2, 3, 4" for 8 bars
2. **Eighth notes**: Say "1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and" for 8 bars
3. **Sixteenth notes**: Say "1-e-and-a 2-e-and-a 3-e-and-a 4-e-and-a" for 8 bars

### Exercise 2: Scatting Variations

Over any beat, practice these scat sounds:

- **Percussive**: "tss tss tss" or "duh duh duh"
- **Melodic**: "da dee da dee daa"
- **Mixed**: "boom bap tss boom bap"

Focus on: hitting different counts (4, 8, 16) with each sound type.

### Exercise 3: Syllable Density

Write one bar with:
1. Only 4 syllables (quarter notes)
2. Exactly 8 syllables (eighth notes)
3. Exactly 16 syllables (sixteenth notes)
4. Mixed pattern (your choice)

Example set:
```
4:  "I can rap well"
8:  "I can rap real-ly real-ly well"
16: "I can rap with a flow that is real-ly real-ly real-ly well"
Mixed: "I can real-ly rap | well and | STRONG | to-day"
```

### Exercise 4: Pattern Repetition

Create a 2-bar cadence pattern, then repeat it 4 times:

```
Bar 1-2 (pattern):
"16th-16th-8th-8th | 16th-16th-8th-8th"

Bar 3-4 (repeat):
[Same rhythm, different words]

Bar 5-6 (repeat):
[Same rhythm, different words]

Bar 7-8 (repeat):
[Same rhythm, different words]
```

## Pattern Templates

All templates shown in 16-column table format.

### Template 1: The Build-Up

Start simple, increase complexity:

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Start** | | | | **with** | | | | **quarter** | | | | **notes** | | | |
| Then | | move | | to | | eighth | | note | | **flow** | | | | | |
| Now | we | speed | it | up | with | six | teenth | note | pat | tern | flows | all | the | **way** | |
| Mix | it | up | | **fast** | and | slow | | **boom** | | bap | | **go** | | | |

**Pattern breakdown**:
- Bar 1: Quarter notes only (columns 1, 5, 9, 13)
- Bar 2: Eighth notes (every other column)
- Bar 3: Full sixteenth notes (almost every column)
- Bar 4: Mixed rhythm (dynamic)

### Template 2: The Pocket

Stay in the rhythmic "pocket" with consistent pattern:

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I'm | stay | ing | in | the | | pock | et | **flow** | | | | | | | |
| Keep | the | same | pat | tern | | ev | ery | **row** | | | | | | | |
| You | can | see | the | rhy | | thm | re | **peat** | | | | | | | |
| Same | ca | dence | makes | it | | sound | so | **sweet** | | | | | | | |

**Pattern breakdown**:
- Same rhythm structure in all 4 bars
- Syllables consistently land in columns 1-9
- Rhymes align in column 9
- Creates hypnotic, pocket-groove feel

### Template 3: The Wave

Alternate between fast and slow:

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fast | flow | here | we | go | with | six | teen | let's | get | it | on | let's | go | right | **now** |
| **Slow** | | | | **down** | | | | **here** | | | | **bro** | | | |
| Pick | it | back | up | a | gain | we | hit | ting | ev | ery | sin | gle | six | teenth | **note** |
| **Drop** | | | | **back** | | | | **slow** | | | | **mo** | | | |

**Pattern breakdown**:
- Bar 1: Dense 16-count flow
- Bar 2: Sparse quarter notes
- Bar 3: Dense 16-count flow again
- Bar 4: Sparse quarter notes
- Creates dynamic tension and release

### Template 4: The Call and Response

Two different patterns that complement each other:

```
Bars 1-2 (Call):   Dense 16th note pattern
Bars 3-4 (Response): Sparse quarter note pattern
[Repeat]
```

## Rhyme Scheme Patterns

### Basic Schemes

**AABB** (Couplets):
```
Line 1 (A): "money"
Line 2 (A): "funny"
Line 3 (B): "game"
Line 4 (B): "fame"
```

**ABAB** (Alternating):
```
Line 1 (A): "street"
Line 2 (B): "mind"
Line 3 (A): "beat"
Line 4 (B): "grind"
```

**AAAA** (Monorhyme):
```
Line 1 (A): "dedication"
Line 2 (A): "elevation"
Line 3 (A): "celebration"
Line 4 (A): "validation"
```

### Internal Rhyme Schemes

Place rhymes inside bars, not just at the ends:

```
"I'm [hitting] every syllable [spitting] with the minimal
[Getting] exponential [letting] all my credentials"

Pattern: Rhyme at positions 2 and 6 of each bar
```

### Multi-Syllable Rhyme Patterns

Rhyme multiple syllables for complexity:

```
Single: "cat" / "bat"
Double: "action" / "passion"
Triple: "verify" / "terrify"
Quadruple: "delivering" / "considering"
```

## Delivery Techniques

### Emphasis Patterns

**Pattern 1**: Emphasize all rhyming words
```
"I'm living in the MOMENT with COMPONENTS"
        (louder)              (louder)
```

**Pattern 2**: Emphasize downbeats (beats 1 and 3)
```
"STEP to the LEFT and STEP to the RIGHT"
 1              2        3             4
```

**Pattern 3**: Dynamic variation
```
Soft → Loud → Soft → Loud across 4 bars
```

### Breath Control

**Rule**: Never run out of air mid-bar

**Technique**:
- Mark breath points with (B) in lyrics
- Breathe on downbeat (beat 1) when possible
- Take quick "snatch breaths" between bars

**Example**:
```
Bar 1: [Full bar, no breath]
Bar 2: [Full bar, no breath]
(B) Bar 3: [Quick breath, then full bar]
Bar 4: [Full bar, no breath]
```

## Advanced Concepts

### Polyrhythms

Using multiple rhythm patterns simultaneously:

- Main flow in 16th notes
- Emphasis pattern in triplets
- Creates rhythmic complexity

### Metric Modulation

Switching the perceived tempo mid-verse:

- Start rapping in 8th notes
- Switch to 16th notes (feels like double-time)
- Beat stays same, but delivery changes perception

### Ghost Notes

Implied syllables that aren't fully pronounced:

```
Written: "I am going to the store"
Delivered: "I'm go'n to the store"
         (some syllables ghosted/shortened)
```

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1**: Ignoring rests/silence
- **Fix**: Silence is part of rhythm. Use it intentionally.

**Mistake 2**: Inconsistent delivery
- **Fix**: Record yourself and check if timing matches your written pattern.

**Mistake 3**: Too complex too soon
- **Fix**: Master simple patterns before attempting advanced techniques.

**Mistake 4**: Forgetting about the beat
- **Fix**: Always practice WITH the instrumental, not a cappella.
