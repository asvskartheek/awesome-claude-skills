Claude Skills: The Secret to Unlimited AI Capabilities

Description:
In this video, I'll show you how to teach Claude Code any skill you want - turning it into a truly versatile AI engineer that can handle any task you throw at it.

I demonstrate the entire process by building a custom Claude Skill from scratch, starting with my original Medium blog post about TF-IDF search engines. You'll see how I:
- Created a structured skill definition that Claude can understand
- Implemented helper scripts and examples
- Taught Claude Code to use the skill effectively
- Tested the skill with real-world scenarios

The best part? Once Claude learns a skill, it can apply it perfectly every time. This means you can build a library of skills for your specific domain - whether it's data science, web development, DevOps, or anything else - and Claude Code becomes an expert in YOUR workflow.

By the end of this video, you'll understand how to create your own Claude Skills and unlock unlimited capabilities for your AI coding assistant.
